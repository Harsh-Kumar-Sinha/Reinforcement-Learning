# Reinforcement-Learning on Retail

- RL in Recommendation System
  Traditional recommendation task can be treated as sequential decision making problem. Recommender (i.e. agent) interacts with users (i.e. environment) to sequentially    suggest set of items. The goal is to maximize clients' satisfaction (i.e. reward).
  
  Reinforcement Learning can help recommendation at least in 2 ways.
  
  1. Userâ€™s preference on previous items will affect his choice on the next items. User tends to give a higher rating if he has consecutively received more satisfied items (and vice versa). So, it would be more reasonable to model the recommendation as a sequential decision making process.

  2. It is important to use long-term planning in recommendations. For example, after reading the weather forecast, the user is not willing to read similar news. On the other hand, after watching funny videos or reading memes the user can constantly do the same.
